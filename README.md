* **bin** The root of the binary tree where the current build system puts libraries, object files and binaries.
* **camera** The camera server directory, this is a C++ server with a thrift interface for controlling the CCD camera.

The Makefile.common file is included in Makefile's to provide common root directory information.

The mookodi_environment.csh can be sourced to setup various environment variables needed to build the camera system.
