DOME CONTROL SERVER DOCUMENT

Starting with version 1.0 of DomeControlTCP, there is a TCP/IP Server interface to DomeControlTCP.

Note: the current version installed at Lesedi has the return string separated by spaces instead of semi-colonâ€™s. The next update, it will change to spaces as is documented here.

First you set up the port number in the Config tab, the textbox labeled "My Port Number"

Note, if something is connected when you change this, there will likely be an exception in the external app. Best to disconnect all TCP processes before changing this DomeControlTCP config item.

The following commands can be used using the ObservatoryControl Server by prefixing the command with "DomeControl_" (ObservatoryControl version 1.1 or later)

You need to be running ServoCommunicator AND SiTechExe before connecting with this software.
Basically, you send an ASCII string as a command, DomeControlTCP possibly does something, and returns a string. Nothing blocks in DomeControlTCP, the string is returned right away, even if the command will take a while to complete.

Unless otherwise stated, every command returns the standard return string. The command "GetDomeData" returns "_" as the message.
Other commands return a message after the "_";

The Standard response String:

Parameters are separated by a ';' semi-colon.
As of version 1.0, here is the standard return string description.
The type (int, double, or string) is a literal string, your software must convert these strings to an int or double if necessary.

int DomePosition (Degs * 10)
int BitsFromDome0 (PLC Register 106Eh (D100) )
int BitsFromDome1 (PLC Register 106Fh (D101) )
int BitsFromDomeDriver (IsMoving, Slaved, BadComm, etc.)
String "_" + ReturnMessage
