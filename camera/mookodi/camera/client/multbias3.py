"""
Command line tool to tell MookodiCameraServer to take a series of bias frames.
The previously configured readout speed, gain, window and binning are used. The command loops over the exposure count,
calls start_bias() to start the camera taking each bias frame, 
and then uses get_state() to determine when the bias has been taken,
and uses get_last_image_filename() to retrieve the FITS image filename generated.
The command returns after MookodiCameraServer has finished taking the bias frames.

./multbias3.py <exposure count>

Parameters:
<exposure count> specifies the number of bias frames to acquire.
