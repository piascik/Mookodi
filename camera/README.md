# Mookodi Camera Server

This directory contains the source code for a C++ server with a thrift interface, that uses the CCD library to drive the Mookodi Andor CCD camera.

## Directory structure

* **interface** This contains the thrift interface file, used to generate the thrift interface source code.
* **server** This contains the C++ source code to build the MookodiCameraServer binary.
* **server/interface** This contains the Makefile for building the thrift interface sources. The sources themselves are generated by running the thift interface compiler on the interface file in the **interface** directory.
* **mookodi** This is the head of python2/3 camera client software. The actual camera client's are in the **mookodi/camera/client** directory (the directory structure enabling the clients to be in a sensible package hierarchy).

## Installing the client code

setup.py has to be invoked to install the client side python libraries. Assuming the Mookodi repo has been cloned into the /home/dev/src/ directory, this can be invoked like this:

* cd /home/dev/src/Mookodi/camera
* sudo tcsh -c "source /home/dev/src/Mookodi/mookodi_environment.csh; python3 setup.py develop"

## Dependancies / Prerequisites

Currently, the package can be built on Ubuntu 18.04 or Ubuntu 20.04. A version of the Andor SDK2 is required for CCD camera control, and CFITSIO is used to write FITS images.

The server interfaces are written using thrift, which needs to be installed.

Other software packages that were installed on the mookodi machine to facilitate building the camera server include:

* **tcsh** *sudo apt install tcsh* The environment setup script is currently written in tcsh.
* **emacs** *sudo apt-get  install emacs* Used for editing.
* **python-setuptools** *sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools* / *sudo apt-get install python-setuptools* Used whilst installing the python client packages.
* **pip** *sudo apt install python3-pip* Used for requests installation
* **requests** *sudo pip3 install requests* Used by the thrift python libraries.
* **boost** Used by the camera C++ server.
* **log4cxx** Used for logging by the camera C++ server.
* **doxygen** *sudo apt-get install doxygen* *sudo apt-get install graphviz* Used for C library and camera server documentation. You need graphviz for dot, which doxygen attempts to use.
* **plibsys** Installed from https://github.com/saprykin/plibsys . Used to provide config file support.

## Running the server

Assuming the Mookodi repo has been cloned into the /home/dev/src/ directory and built, the MookodiCameraServer can be started as follows:

* tcsh
* source /home/dev/src/Mookodi/mookodi_environment.csh
* cd /home/dev/src/Mookodi/bin/mookodi/camera/server/x86_64-linux
* ./MookodiCameraServer --config_file /home/dev/src/Mookodi/config/mkd.cfg

If there is no Andor camera present, the server can be started in emulation mode for testing purposes:

* ./MookodiCameraServer --config_file /home/dev/src/Mookodi/config/mkd.cfg --emulate_camera


## Running the command-line clients

There is a series of command line clients that can be used for camera testing. Assuming the Mookodi repo has been cloned into the /home/dev/src/ directory and setup.py run, they can be run as follows:

* tcsh
* source /home/dev/src/Mookodi/mookodi_environment.csh
* cd /home/dev/src/Mookodi/camera/mookodi/camera/client
* Run the command line test program. Available programs:
  * ***abort_exposure3.py***  - Abort a presiously started bias/dark/exposure.
  * ***add_fits_header3.py*** - Add a FITS header keyword/value to the internally maintained list.
  * ***clear_fits_headers3.py*** - Clear the internally maintained list of FITS headers
  * ***clear_window3.py*** - Clear any sub-image windows defined - make the detector read out full-frame.
  * ***cool_down3.py*** - Start the camera cooling down.
  * ***do_biases.py*** - Do a defined set of bias frames.
  * ***do_darks.py*** - Do a defined set of dark frames.
  * ***get_image_data3.py*** - Exercises the get_image_data API, which returns the read out data in memory.
  * ***get_last_image_filename3.py*** - Get the filename of the last FITS image saved by the server.
  * ***get_state3.py*** - Get and print out the current state of the server/camera/camera temeprature.
  * ***multbias3.py*** - Take a series of bias frames.
  * ***multdark3.py*** - Take a series of dark frames
  * ***multrun3.py*** - Take a series of exposures.
  * ***set_binning3.py*** - Set the detectyor binning.
  * ***set_gain3.py*** - Set the detector gain.
  * ***set_readout_speed3.py*** - Set how quickly the detector is read out.
  * ***set_window3.py*** - Set a sub-image of the full frame to read out.
  * ***soak_test.py*** - Do a series of exposures to test the camera server.
  * ***start_bias3.py*** - Start taking a bias frame. Use get_state3.py to monitor for completion.
  * ***start_dark3.py*** - Start taking a dark frame. Use get_state3.py to monitor for completion.
  * ***start_expose3.py*** - Start taking an exposure.  Use get_state3.py to monitor for completion.
  * ***warm_up3.py*** - Start warming up the detector to ambient.
