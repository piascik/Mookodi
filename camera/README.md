# Mookodi Camera Server

This directory contains the source code for a C++ server with a thrift interface, that uses the CCD library to drive the Mookodi Andor CCD camera.

## Directory structure

* **interface** This contains the thrift interface file, used to generate the thrift interface source code.
* **server** This contains the C++ source code to build the MookodiCameraServer binary.
* **server/interface** This contains the Makefile for building the thrift interface sources. The sources themselves are generated by running the thift interface compiler on the interface file in the **interface** directory.
* **mookodi** This is the head of python2/3 camera client software. The actual camera client's are in the **mookodi/camera/client** directory (the directory structure enabling the clients to be in a sensible package hierarchy).

## Installing the client code

setup.py has to be invoked to install the client side python libraries. This can be invoked like this:

sudo tcsh -c "source /home/dev/src/Mookodi/mookodi_environment.csh; python3 setup.py develop"
