This is the SAAo toy with the pipeline functions added as two new controllers
ReductionController.py and AcquisitionController.py.

Documentation for this is in GoogleDocs:

The functions can be tested using test.py but you need to generate the test FITS
first. The python script in testdata will create a set of test data for you and then 
you can run test.py
