This extends the SAAO toy with the pipeline functions added as two new controllers
ReductionController.py and AcquisitionController.py.

The functions can be tested using test.py but you need to generate the test FITS
first. The python script in testdata will create a set of test data for you and then 
you can run test.py. E.g., 
 cd testdata
 ./generate_testdata.py
 cd ..
 ./test.py
